# Summary 

1. **`RowHouses(int[] money)`**
   - Solves the problem of robbing non-adjacent houses in a row using dynamic programming.
   - Keeps track of the maximum robbed amount without alerting adjacent alarms.

2. **`RoundHouses(int[] money)`**
   - Handles houses arranged in a circular manner where the first and last houses are adjacent.
   - Divides the problem into two cases: exclude the first house or the last house, and computes the maximum for each.

3. **`SquareHouse(int[] money)`**
   - Identical to `RowHouses` as the constraints are the same (no robbing of adjacent houses).
   - Uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum robbed amount.

4. **`MuliHouseBuilding(int[][] houses)`**
   - Processes multiple types of houses, represented as a 2D array.
   - Computes the maximum robbed amount for each row (house type) independently using the `RowHouses` logic and sums up the results.
